## Usage

Source files are located in `./src` folder. Running `yarn run build` will compile them for production and store them in the `./dist` folder.

For a simple development server with live reloading run `yarn start`. Webpack will serve your bundled files at `localhost:8080` and open a browser window. Whenever a file changes, webpack recompiles and reloads the browser window.

Files in `./dist` folder are meant to be statically served with an http server.
